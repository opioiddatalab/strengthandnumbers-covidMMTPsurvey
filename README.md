## Survey to Assess Methadone Access During COVID-19
Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is a type of opioid treatment that typically requires participants to take prescribed doses at their clinic. While methadone can be a lifesaving medication for people with opioid use disorder, the requirement of daily in-person clinic visits can be an extremely challenging barrier to access for MMT participants.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration issued [guidance to Opioid Treatment Programs](https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/otp-guidance-20200316.pdf/) which expanded participant eligibility to access methadone doses, specifically loosening regulations surrounding take-home doses. Our team is conducting a needs assessment to describe the perceptions about, and changes to, MMT access in the Piedmont region of North Carolina during COVID-19.

Our work was recently [published online pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.31.20185249v1/), meaning it has not completed the peer review process in a scientific journal. The contents are preliminary and subject to change. However, we are providing the information back to the community given the urgent nature of this topic area.
